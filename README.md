Foogle
======

Foogle is a social webapp(initially designed for mozilla firefox os) that uses Facebook Graph API, Google maps API and Google Geocoding Service to locate user's nearby facebook friends on google maps. It is hosted at http://web.iiit.ac.in/~sreenatha.b/foogle.

Currently, foogle has 2 main functionalities

1.Find Friends : Lists your facebook friends on the right and displays a google map on the left. Clicking on a friend-button will mark his/her locations on the google map. 

2.Locate Friends : Given a location and a latitude-longitude range(an integer), locates user's facebook friends whose current locations are within that range of the input location on the google map.
